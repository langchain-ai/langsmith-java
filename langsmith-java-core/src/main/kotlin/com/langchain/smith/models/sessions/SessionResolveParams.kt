/**
 * **Beta:** This endpoint is in active development and may change without notice. Returns the
 * tracing project (session) an address names. An address is an AGENT (`id` and `environment`), an
 * EXPERIMENT (`id`), or an EVALUATOR (no `id`: evaluator traces share one project per workspace).
 * Send `kind` and `environment` in upper case, as listed; they are matched case-insensitively,
 * while the Agent `id` is case-sensitive. An address that does not exist, or whose project you
 * cannot read, is a 404. Pass the returned `session_id` to any endpoint that takes a project
 * (session) ID. This is not supported on a BYOC data plane yet, and is a 501 there.
