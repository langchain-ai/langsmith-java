/**
 * A client for interacting with the Langsmith API REST API asynchronously. You can also switch to
 * synchronous execution via the [sync] method.
 *
 * This client performs best when you create a single instance and reuse it for all interactions
 * with the REST API. This is because each client holds its own connection pool and thread pools.
 * Reusing connections and threads reduces latency and saves memory. The client also handles rate
 * limiting per client. This means that creating and using multiple instances at the same time will
 * not respect rate limits.
 *
 * The threads and connections that are held will be released automatically if they remain idle. But
 * if you are writing an application that needs to aggressively release unused resources, then you
 * may call [close].
